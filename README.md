# simple-time-clock

Simple time clock Java application developed using Swing and SQLite.

Two users are preloaded:
- demoUser: basic app functions
- adminUser: admin functions

New users may be registered by entering a new username at login and clicking Create.

Admins have permission to view the logs of all time clock entries. 
Admins may also perform any function without restrictions (i.e. ending a shift before ending a break).
